This project is for my wedding website. It is still very new and only has about 10 hours of work into it at the time of the intitial commit.

The backend is using node.js/express and is being hosted on my personal server. The site is publicly available for veiw at http://45.55.190.143:3000, or year9finallymine.com will redirect you.

The frontend is a Single Page Application using angular.js/bootstrap. It is responsive to screen sizing. View is changeable based on which list item button you have selected.
